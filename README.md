# nf-core_McCleary_RNAseq

Reference: https://nf-co.re/configs/mccleary/

Step 1: 
Make a spreadsheet which has header:
```
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
```

Step 2: 
```
python3 make_samplesheet.py -i path/to/folder/where/RNAseq_data/is/available
```

or if the file of each run is in a folder (sample(folder) --- R1 and R2) and you want to make one file at the end
```
python3 make_samplesheet1.py -i path/to/folder/where/RNAseq_data/is/available/Sample_* -o samplesheet1.csv
```

If getting into storage issues, split the csv file in groups of 20 and run the analysis
```
header=$(head -n1 samplesheet.csv); tail -n +2 samplesheet.csv | split -l 20 - samplesheet_ && for f in samplesheet_*; do (echo "$header"; cat "$f") > "${f}.csv"; rm "$f"; done
```

Step 3:
Use local_config.sh
and run the bash script
```
sbatch nfcore_bash.sh
```
